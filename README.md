# tjin-x-cahyadi
tjin-x-cahyadi is a Growtopia farming automation script for Teng Tjin Yao. I am not responsible if you get banned for using this, but I'm pretty sure no one even plays Growtopia in 2017 so it probably won't matter. **macOS exclusive**. Confirmed to work on El Capitan, may not work for older versions. All versions require a pickaxe equipped. Script is designed to farm 400 items every run. Also Tjin x Cahyadi is Tjin one-sided official canon.

# Getting started

**Installing**

Download and unzip. Run whichever version of the script you need, depending on the number of hits it takes to destroy the item you're farming. Test it yourself if you're unsure. Running a different script will return sub-optimal results.

If you get a warning saying you can't open the file because it's from an unidentified developer, rightclick the file and select Open. A different dialog box will open with the option to open it.

**Setup**

1. Give the program assistive access. System Preferences > Security and Privacy > Accessibility. Tick the box for tjin-x-cahyadi.
2. Open Growtopia and login. Go to the world you will farm in. Growtopia view must be fully zoomed in.
3. Inventory must be expanded so the adjuster is directly below your character's feet.
4. Item to be farmed must be in the second inventory slot. 
5. Must have pickaxe equipped. 
6. Select item to be farmed before running the program.
7. Do not interfere with the program once it has started running except to disable it. The program will auto-farm 1000 items before it must be restarted.
8. Try to position yourself facing left and slightly off-centre of a block, but this is not mandatory. May possibly cause some issues at higher levels of the loop if this is not done, though unlikely.
